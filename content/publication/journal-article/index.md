  The past two decades have established that people generally have insight into
  their personalities, but less is known about how and why self-knowledge might
  vary between individuals. Using the Realistic Accuracy Model as a framework,
  we investigate whether some people make better “targets” of self-perception by
  behaving more consistently in everyday life, and whether these differences
  have benefits for psychological adjustment. 

  Using data from the Electronically Activated Recorder (n = 286), we indexed self-knowledge as the link between self-reports of personality and actual daily behavior measured over 1 week. We then tested if consistency in daily behavior as well as psychological adjustment predicted stronger self-knowledge.

  We found that behaving more consistently in everyday life was associated with more accurate self-reports, but that psychological adjustment was not.

  Analogous to interpersonal perception, self-knowledge of personality might be affected by “target-side” factors, like the quality of information provided through one's behavior. However, unlike being a good target of interpersonal perception, self-knowledge does not seem to be related to psychological adjustment.
